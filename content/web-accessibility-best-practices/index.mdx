# The Power of JavaScript Frameworks: Angular vs. React vs. Vue.js




Most frameworks don’t support promises.
Whether this works depends on that.

it wasn’t allowed.

### ES2024 in MDX

You can now use modern JavaScript syntax in MDX.
Acorn, used internally, is now instructed to use ES2024.

## Miscellaneous

I refactored all the docs.
Updating every use example where needed.
I also wrote a guide on how to inject components from anywhere:

## Angular

Angular is a comprehensive framework developed and maintained by Google. It's designed for building large-scale enterprise applications and offers a wide range of built-in tools and features.

### Key Features
- **Full-Stack Framework**: Angular is a complete framework with built-in support for HTTP client, routing, forms, testing, and more.
- **TypeScript-Based**: Angular is developed in TypeScript, offering static typing and enhanced developer tooling.
- **Dependency Injection**: Angular's dependency injection system simplifies code modularity and testing.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular uses a hierarchical component structure.

### Strengths
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Angular is designed for large-scale applications with extensive built-in functionality.
- **Consistent Structure**: Angular's strict structure promotes code consistency and best practices.
- **Strong Community and Ecosystem**: Angular has a large community and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools.

### Weaknesses
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Angular's complexity can be challenging for new developers.
- **Verbose**: Angular's strict structure often requires more boilerplate code.

## React

React, developed by Facebook (now Meta), is a flexible library for building user interfaces. It focuses on the view layer, providing a simple and efficient way to create interactive components.

### Key Features
- **Component-Based**: React's component architecture promotes code reusability and modularity.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, reducing complexity.

### Strengths
- **Flexibility**: React's simplicity allows developers to choose their preferred libraries and tools for state management, routing, etc.
- **Large Community**: React has a vast community and a rich ecosystem of libraries.
- **High Performance**: The virtual DOM optimizes rendering for fast user experiences.

### Weaknesses
- **Additional Tools Required**: React's flexibility means you need to choose additional libraries for routing, state management, etc.
- **Learning Curve**: React's concepts, like JSX and the virtual DOM, require a learning period.

## Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive framework that combines simplicity and flexibility. It's designed to be incrementally adoptable, allowing developers to start small and scale as needed.

### Key Features
- **Incremental Adoption**: Vue.js can be integrated into existing projects or used for full-scale applications.
- **Reactive Data Binding**: Vue.js offers reactive two-way data binding, simplifying form handling and state management.
- **Single-File Components**: Vue.js supports single-file components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combined.

### Strengths
- **Easy to Learn**: Vue.js is known for its simple learning curve and approachable documentation.
- **Versatility**: Vue.js is flexible, suitable for both small and large projects.
- **Strong Community**: Vue.js has a growing community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.

### Weaknesses
- **Smaller Ecosystem**: Vue.js has a smaller ecosystem compared to React and Angular.
- **Limited Enterprise Adoption**: While growing, Vue.js has less enterprise backing than Angular or React.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right JavaScript framework depends on your project requirements, team expertise, and preferences. Angular is ideal for large-scale enterprise applications, React offers flexibility and a large ecosystem, and Vue.js provides a simple yet powerful framework. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each framework, you can make an informed decision for your next web development project.
